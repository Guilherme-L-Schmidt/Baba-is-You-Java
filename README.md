# Baba is You in Java

Repository created to contain the main coding project proposed in the Object Oriented Programming course at USP.

For the project, we remade the first 8 levels of the game "Baba is You" in java, using OOP concepts.

All the art and mechanics here used belong to the original game's developer. 

We strongly suggest you take a look at [https://hempuli.com/baba/](https://hempuli.com/baba/).
